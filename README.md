## Acknowledgements
I completed the work for this project during my PhD under the supervision of [Dr. Anmar Khadra](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/physio/khadralab/) and in collaboration with [Dr. Derek Bowie](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/pharma/dbowielab/) at McGill Univeristy. The electrophysiology data used for fitting was collected by Adamo Mancino, who at the time was a master's student in the Bowie lab. Figure 3 of the paper presents voltage-clamp fluormetry data, which was collected by Adamo Mancino and Yuhao Yan while visting the lab of Dr. Yoshihiro Kubo at the National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Japan.
